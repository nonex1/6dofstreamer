**FaceAPI Licensing**

faceAPI is available under Non-Commercial, Development and Production licenses.

Non-commercial licenses are strictly for non-commercial purposes only, and are not as fully-featured as a Development license. The full text of the non-commercial license is available below. Primarily:

  * Non-commercial means you are not being compensated in any form for the application you develop using Seeing Machines faceAPI. This includes non-monetary payment, in-kind payments, or any other form of compensation. Please note academic use of the faceAPI does not qualify for a non-commercial license. Academics must purchase a development license, but we do have special programs in place for academics. Contact us for more information.

  * If you release, transmit, or make available any application you have written using the Non-Commercial license, you must also release the source-code for your application, as well as the faceAPI non-commercial license in its unmodified form.

  * The non-commercial version of the faceAPI does not have all the features and  capabilities that are available with a full Development License.
